### Expense Manager

An application for accounting personal expenses. In the future, a full-fledged financial assistant.

The project uses the [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/) utility and provides the following commands:
- *build* - to build the project
- *up* - to start the project
- *tests* - to run tests
- *check* - to run isort, black and mypy checkers (**for now, use it before commits!**)
- *check-tests* - same as the *check* command, but for tests.
If you don't use [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/) utility, you can just copy commands from the relevant "cmds" items.
